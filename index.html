    <h2>What is Sankalp?</h2>
    <p>
      Sankalp is the only public administration, general affairs and history club on this campus. 
      With 60+ active members and an expected expansion to 100+ soon, Sankalp functions as a structured body inspired by administrative systems. 
      Our members routinely write reports, policy notes, event analyses and evaluation documents — all of which help improve our functioning and transparency.
